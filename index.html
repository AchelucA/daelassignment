      <p><strong>An independent video game or indie game</strong> is a video game typically
        created by individuals or smaller development teams without
        the financial and technical support of a large game publisher,
        <u>in contrast to most "AAA" (triple-A) games</u>.<br>However, the <strong>"indie"</strong> term
        may apply to other scenarios where the development of the game has some
        measure of independence from a publisher even if a publishers helps
        fund and distribute a game, such as creative freedom.<br>Because of their
        independence and freedom to develop, indie games often
        focus on <u>innovation, experimental gameplay, and taking risks</u>
        not usually afforded in AAA games, and may explore the medium to
        produce unique experiences in art games.<br>Indie games tend to be sold
        through digital distribution channels rather than at retail due to
        lack of publisher support. The term is synonymous with that of
        independent music or independent film in those respective mediums.</p>
