    <h2>1. Publishing</h2>
      <p>While most indie games lack a publisher with the developer serving in that role, a number of publishers
      geared towards indie games have been established since 2010, also known as boutique game publishers;
      these include Raw Fury, Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive and Adult Swim Games. There also have been a number of
      indie developers that have grown large enough on their own to also support publishing for smaller developers, such as Chucklefish,
      Coffee Stain Studios, and Team17. These boutique publishers, having experience in making indie games themselves,
      typically will provide necessary financial support and marketing but have little to no creative control on developers' product
      as to maintain the "indie" nature of the game. In some cases, the publisher may be more selective of the type of games it supported;
      Annapurna Interactive sought games that were "personal, emotional and original".</p>
    <h2>2. Funding</h2>
      <p>The lack of a publisher requires an indie developer to find means to fund the game themselves.
      Existing studios may be able to rely on past funds and incoming revenue, but new studios may need to use their own personal funds
      ("bootstrapping"), personal or bank loans, or investments to cover development costs, or building community support while in development.</p>
      <p>More recently, crowd-funding campaigns, both reward-based and equity-based, have been used to obtain the funds from interested consumers before development begins in earnest.
      While using crowd-funding for video games took off in 2012, its practice has significantly waned as consumers became wary of campaigns that failed to deliver on promised goods.
      A successful crowd-funded campaign typically required significant development work and costs associated with before the campaign is launched
      to demonstrate that the game will likely be completed in a timely manner to draw in funds.</p>
      <p>Another mechanism offered through digital distribution is the early access model, in which interested players can buy playable beta versions of the game
      to provide software testing and gameplay feedback. Those consumers become entitled the full game for free on release, while others may have
      to pay a higher price for the final. This can provide funding midway though development, but like with crowd-funding, consumers expect a game that
      is near completion, so significant development and costs will have had to been invested already. Minecraft was considered an indie game during its original development,
      and was one of the first titles to successfully demonstrate this approach to funding.</p>
      <p>More recently, a number of dedicated investor-based indie game funds have been established such as the Indie Fund. Indie developers
      can submit applications requesting grants from these funds. The money is typically provided as a seed investment to be repaid through game royalties.
      Several national governments, through their public arts agencies, also have made similar grants available to indie developers.</p>
